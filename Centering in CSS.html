            <p>In refuting that suffering does not exist inherently Shantideva wants us to consider that if suffering was inherent, 
            that same suffering would last forever. The suffering of pain etc would exist independently, and would not depend on other
            factors, the sensations would continue on and on and joyful experiences would be impossible. Some maintain that on a subtle
            level some degree of happiness remains intrinsically whilst in a state of suffering. And that the pleasure , or sometimes in 
            the instance of suffering, had simply been overshadowed temporarily. But this is impossible as these transient feelings cannot 
            both be forms of suffering and pleasure at the same time. We can see happiness being generated in someone so how could suffering 
            have been inherently present.The second part of the verse is refuting inherent feelings by asking us to consider a person in agony, 
            say his father had recently died. This same man usually who usually experiences pleasure at the tastes of certain foods is not consoled at all 
            by these foods in his state of grief. If the pleasure exited inherently the food would provide joy to his mind in his state of misery.</p>
