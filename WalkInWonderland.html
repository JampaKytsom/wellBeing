<h6> ONCE UPON A TIME</h6>
<p> A long, long time ago, there was a monk called Shantideva who lived in a country, far, far away. This chap had a reputation for sleeping 'All' the time. Now the other monks who were diligent about getting up early for meditation, and were committed to their altruistic practices, decided to humiliate Shantideva. 
They made a high throne and asked Shantideva to lead them in practices.
Not only did Shantideva have many words of wisdom to share, as the story is told, Shantideva rose into the air after his teachings. It is told that he was seen occasionally afterwards. So why is it told that Shantideva rose into the air? Was it in relation to the idea's written in his Chapter 9 of the Bodhisattva's way of life?
